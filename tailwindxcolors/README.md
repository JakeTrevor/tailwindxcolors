# tailwindxcolors

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a popular styling library for web development.
It ships with a fairly nice built-in color palette, which many people have become accustomed to using. 
This package adds xcolor color definitions for all the built-in tailwind colors.

For information on the colors provided, see the [tailwind colors documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors).

To use it, just include the package. 
All the normal xcolor commands will work.
For example:
